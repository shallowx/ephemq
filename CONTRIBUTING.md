## How to submit a bug report

Please ensure to specify the following:

* Contextual information (e.g. what you were trying to achieve with meteor)
* Simplest possible steps to reproduce
    * More complex the steps are, lower the priority will be.
  * A pull request with failing JUnit test case is most preferred, although it's OK to paste the test case into the
    issue description.
* Anything that might be relevant in your opinion, such as:
    * JDK/JRE version or the output of `java -version`
    * Operating system and the output of `uname -a`
    * Network configuration
